              methodology for assessing and comparing students' learning
              behaviors from these interaction traces. The core algorithm
              employs sequence mining techniques to identify differentially
              frequent patterns between two predefined groups. We extend this
              technique by contextualizing the sequence mining with information
              on the student's task performance and learning activities.
              Specifically, we study transformation of action sequences using
              action features, such as activity categorizations, relevance and
              timing between actions, and repetition of analogous actions. We
              employ a piecewise linear segmentation algorithm in concert with
              the action transformation and differential sequence mining
              techniques to identify and compare segments of students'
              productive and unproductive learning behaviors. We present the
              results of this methodology applied to a recent middle school
              class study, in which students learned about climate change. Our
              primary focus in this analysis is the effectiveness and variation
              in the reading behaviors of high-versus low-performing students.
              These results illustrate the potential of this iterative

              measuring dissimilarities between state sequences. The
              originality of the study is the focus put on the differences
              between sequences that are sociologically important when studying
              life courses such as family life trajectories or professional
              careers. These differences essentially concern the sequencing
              (the order in which successive states appear), the timing and the
              duration of the spells in successive states. The study examines
              the sensitivity of the measures to these three aspects
              analytically and empirically by means of simulations. Even if
              some distance measures underperform, the study shows that there
              is no universally optimal distance index, and that the choice of
              a measure depends on which aspect we want to focus on. From the
              review and simulation results, the paper derives guidelines to
              help the end user to choose the right dissimilarity measure for
              her or his research objectives. This study also introduces novel

  abstract = "Applications of optimal matching analysis in the social sciences
              are typically based on sequences of specific social statuses that
              model the residential, family, or occupational trajectories of
              individuals. Despite the broadly recognized interdependence of
              these statuses, few attempts have been made to systematize the
              ways in which optimal matching analysis should be applied
              multidimensionally-that is, in an approach that takes into
              account multiple trajectories simultaneously. Based on methods
              pioneered in the field of bioinformatics, this paper proposes a
              method of multichannel sequence analysis (MCSA) that
              simultaneously extends the usual optimal matching analysis (OMA)
              to multiple life spheres. Using data from the Swiss household
              panel (SHP), we examine the types of trajectories obtained using
              MCSA. We also consider a random data set and find that MCSA

              matrices by locally aligning distinct life trajectories
              simultaneously. Moreover, MCSA reduces the complexity of the
              typologies it allows to produce, without making them less
              informative. It is more robust to noise in the data, and it
              provides more reliable alignments than two independent OMA.

               theoretical orientations. The primary focus of our analysis was
               a framework with four dimensions of learning (i.e., the what,

               contexts. This study extends a previously published work by
               examining the generalisability of a learning analytics method
               proposed for detecting learning tactics and strategies from
               trace data. The method was applied to the datasets collected in
               in three different course designs and delivery modalities,
               including flipped classroom, blended learning, and massive open
               online course. The proposed method combines process mining and
               sequence analysis. The detected learning strategies are explored
               in terms of their association with the academic performance. The
               results indicate the applicability of the proposed method across
               different learning contexts. Moreover, the findings contribute
               to the understanding of the learning tactics and strategies
               identified in the trace data: the learning tactics proved to be
               responsive to the course design, whereas the learning strategies
               were found to be more sensitive to the delivery modalities than
               the course design. These findings, well-aligned with
               self-regulated learning theory, highlight the association of the
               learning contexts and the choice of learning tactics and
               strategies. Notes for Practice • Exploration on the detected
               learning tactics and strategies need to consider both sequential
               and temporal characteristics • Learning tactics and strategies
               are context dependent, therefore, specific learning tactics and
               strategies have to be interpreted in the particular learning
               context from which the data originate • Detected learning

               provides a useful measure for degrees of difference, that is,
               the substantive significance, and the statistical significance
               of differences between predefined groups of life-course
               trajectories. The authors present a simulation study and an
               empirical application on whether employment life-courses
               converged after reunification in the former East Germany and
               West Germany, using data for six birth-cohort groups ages 15 to
               40 years from the German National Education Panel Study. The new
               methods allow the authors to show that convergence of employment
               life-courses around reunification was stronger for men than for
               women and that it was most pronounced in terms of the duration
               of employment states but weaker for their order and timing in
               the life-course. Convergence of East German and West German
               women?s employment lives set in earlier and reflects a secular
               trend toward a more gender-egalitarian division of labor in West
               Germany that is unrelated to reunification. The simulation study
               and the substantive application demonstrate the usefulness of
               the proposed BIC and LRT methods for assessing group differences
               in sequence data.",

               and acquiring practical skills. Hence, analyzing learners' data
               from online learning environments alone fails to capture the
               full breadth of students' actions if part of their learning
               process takes place elsewhere. Moreover, existing studies on
               learning analytics applied to programming education have mainly
               relied on frequency analysis to classify students according to
               their approach to programming or to predict academic
               achievement. However, frequency analysis provides limited
               insights into the individual time-related characteristics of the
               learning process. The current study examines students'
               strategies when learning programming, combining data from the

               copy and paste. We also found that videos are relatively less
               consumed by students, especially while working on programming
               assignments. Lastly, students resort to course forums to seek

              course or two, while longitudinal studies remain scarce. The
              present study examines the longitudinal sequence of students'
              strategies, their succession, consistency, temporal unfolding,
              and whether students tend to retain or adapt strategies between
              courses. We use a large dataset of online traces from 135
              students who completed 10 successive courses (i.e., 1350 course
              enrollments) in a higher education program. The methods used in
              this study have shown the feasibility of using trace data
              recorded by learning management systems to unobtrusively trace
              and model the longitudinal learning strategies across a program.
              We identified three program-level strategy trajectories: a stable
              and intense trajectory related to deep learning where students
              used diverse strategies and scored the highest grades; a
              fluctuating interactive trajectory, where students focused on
              course requirements, scored average grades, and were relatively
              fluctuating; and a light trajectory related to surface learning
              where students invested the least effort, scored the lowest
              grades, and had a relatively stable pathway. Students who were
              intensely active were more likely to transfer the intense
              strategies and therefore, they were expected to require less

              were not as effective self-regulators as they seemed and possibly
              required early guidance and support from teachers. Students with

              themselves with the goals, objectives and requirements of the new
              learning environment. Students' ability to continuously
              self-regulate their writing process, therefore, is seen as a
              determining factor in their learning success. In order to study
              students' self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviour, research has
              increasingly been tapping into learning analytics (LA) methods in
              recent years, making use of multimodal trace data that can be
              obtained from students writing and working online. Nevertheless,
              little is still known about the ways students apply and govern
              SRL processes for academic writing online, and about how their
              SRL behaviour might change over time. To provide new perspectives
              on the use of LA approaches to examine SRL, this study applied a
              range of methods to investigate what they could tell us about the
              evolution of SRL tactics and strategies on a relational,
              co-temporal, contemporaneous and longitudinal level. The data
              originates from a case study in which a private Facebook group
              served as an online collaboration space in a first-year academic
              writing course for foreign language majors of English. The
              findings show that learners use a range of SRL tactics to manage
              their writing tasks and that different tactic can take up key
              positions in this process over time. Several shifts could be
              observed in students' behaviour, from mainly addressing
              content-specific topics to more form-specific and social ones.
              Our results have also demonstrated that different methods can be
              used to study the relational, co-temporal, contemporaneous, and
              longitudinal dynamics of self-regulation in this regard,

              are multiple parallel sequences per subject. Hidden (latent)
              Markov models (HMMs) are able to detect underlying latent
              structures and they can be used in various longitudinal settings:
              to account for measurement error, to detect unobservable states,
              or to compress information across several types of observations.
              Extending to mixture hidden Markov models (MHMMs) allows
              clustering data into homogeneous subsets, with or without

              anniversary by reflecting on the progress of sequence analysis
              (SA) since its introduction into the social sciences four decades
              ago, with focuses on the developments of SA thus far in the
              social sciences and on its potential future directions. The
              application of SA in the social sciences, especially in life
              course research, has mushroomed in the last decade and a half.
              Using a life course analogy, we examined the birth of SA in the
              social sciences and its childhood (the first wave), its
              adolescence and young adulthood (the second wave), and its future
              mature adulthood in the paper. The paper provides a summary of
              (1) the important SA research and the historical contexts in
              which SA was developed by Andrew Abbott, (2) a thorough review of
              the many methodological developments in visualization, complexity
              measures, dissimilarity measures, group analysis of
              dissimilarities, cluster analysis of dissimilarities,
              multidomain/multichannel SA, dyadic/polyadic SA, Markov chain SA,
              sequence life course analysis, sequence network analysis, SA in
              other social science research, and software for SA, and (3)
              reflections on some future directions of SA including how SA can
              benefit and inform theory-making in the social sciences, the
              methods currently being developed, and some remaining challenges
              facing SA for which we do not yet have any solutions. It is our
              hope that the reader will take up the challenges and help us
              improve and grow SA into maturity.",

              event or state sequences describing life courses, although most
              of its features apply also to non temporal data such as text or
              DNA sequences for instance. The name TraMineR is a contraction of
              Life Trajectory Miner for R. Indeed, as some may expect, it was
              also inspired by the authors' taste for Gewurztraminer wine. This

              usage of the TraMineR package. It may also serve, however, as an
              introduction to sequential data analysis. The presentation is
              illustrated with data from the social sciences. Illustrative data
              sets and R scripts (sequence of R-commands) 1 are included in the
              TraMineR distribution package. For newcomers to R, a short
              introduction to the R-environment is given in Appendix A in which
              the reader will learn where R can be obtained as well as its

  abstract = "Student engagement has a trajectory (a timeline) that unfolds
              over time and can be shaped by different factors including
              learners' motivation, school conditions, and the nature of
              learning tasks. Such factors may result in either a stable,
              declining or fluctuating engagement trajectory. While research on
              online engagement is abundant, most authors have examined student
              engagement in a single course or two. Little research has been
              devoted to studying online longitudinal engagement, i.e., the
              evolution of student engagement over a full educational program.
              This learning analytics study examines the engagement states
              (sequences, successions, stability, and transitions) of 106
              students in 1396 course enrollments over a full program. All data
              of students enrolled in the academic year 2014--2015, and their
              subsequent data in 2015--2016, 2016--2017, and 2017--2018 (15
              courses) were collected. The engagement states were clustered
              using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to uncover the hidden engagement
              trajectories which resulted in a mostly-engaged (33\% of
              students), an intermediate (39.6\%), and a troubled (27.4\%)
              trajectory. The mostly-engaged trajectory was stable with
              infrequent changes, scored the highest, and was less likely to
              drop out. The troubled trajectory showed early disengagement,
              frequent dropouts and scored the lowest grades. The results of
              our study show how to identify early program disengagement
              (activities within the third decile) and when students may drop
              out (first year and early second year).",

  abstract = "Supporting teaching and learning programming with learning
              analytics is an active area of inquiry. Most learning management
              systems were not developed to support learning programming.
              Therefore, educators have to resort to other systems that support
              the programming process, which can pose a challenge when it comes
              to understanding students' learning since it takes place in
              different contexts. Methods that support the combination of
              different data sources are needed. Such methods would ideally
              account for the time-ordered sequence of students' learning
              actions. In this article, we use a novel method (multi-channel
              sequence mining with Hidden Markov Models, HMMs) that allows the
              combination of multiple data sources, accounts for the temporal
              nature of students' learning actions, and maps the transitions
              between different learning tactics. Our study included 291
              students enrolled in a higher education programming course.
              Students' trace-log data were collected from the learning
              management system and from a programming automated assessment
              tool. Data were analyzed using multi-channel sequence mining and
              HMM. The results reveal different patterns of students'
              approaches to learning programming. High achievers start earlier
              to work on the programming assignments, use more independent
              strategies and consume learning resources more frequently, while
              the low achievers procrastinate early in the course and rely on
              help forums. Our findings demonstrate the potentials of
              multi-channel sequence mining and how this method can be analyzed
              using HMM. Furthermore, the results obtained can be of use for
              educators to understand students' strategies when learning
              programming.",

              of learning strategies in different course implementations, the
              transfer of learning strategies between courses and relationship
              to performance. We took advantage of recent advances in learning
              analytics methods, namely sequence and process mining as well as
              statistical methods and visualisations to study how students
              regulate their online learning through learning strategies. The
              study included 81,739 log traces of students' learning related
              activities from two different problem-based learning medical
              courses. The results revealed that students who applied deep
              learning strategies were more likely to score high grades, and
              students who applied surface learning strategies were more likely
              to score lower grades in either course. More importantly,
              students who were able to transfer deep learning strategies or
              continue to use effective strategies between courses obtained
              higher scores, and were less likely to adopt surface strategies
              in the subsequent course. These results highlight the need for
              supporting the development of effective learning strategies in
              problem-based learning curricula so that students adopt and
              transfer effective strategies as they advance through the
              programme. Implications for practice or policy: Teachers need to
              help students develop and transfer deep learning as they are
              directly related to success. Students who continue to use light
              strategies are more at risk of low achievement and need to be
              supported. Technology-supported problem-based learning requires
              more active scaffolding and teachers' support beyond ``guide on
              the side'' as in face-to-face.",

The originality of the study is the focus put on the differences between sequences that are sociologically important when studying life courses such as family life trajectories or professional careers. These differences essentially concern the sequencing (the order in which successive states appear), the timing and the duration of the spells in successive states. The study examines the sensitivity of the measures to these three aspects analytically and empirically by means of simulations. Even if some distance measures underperform, the study shows that there is no universally optimal distance index, and that the choice of a measure depends on which aspect we want to focus on. From the review and simulation results, the paper derives guidelines to help the end user to choose the right dissimilarity measure for her or his research objectives.
