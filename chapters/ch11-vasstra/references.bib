Our study intends to add to this emerging body of research by analyzing the longitudinal trajectories of interaction between student engagement and achievement over a full four-year program. We use learning analytics and life-course methods to study how achievement and engagement are intertwined and how such relationship evolves over a full program for 106 students. Our findings have indicated that the association between engagement and achievement varies between students and progresses differently between such groups over time. Our results showed that online engagement at any single time-point is not a consistent indicator for high achievement. It takes more than a single point of time to reliably forecast high achievement throughout the program. Longitudinal high grades, or longitudinal high levels of engagement (either separately or combined) were indicators of a stable academic trajectory in which students remained engaged ---at least on average--- and had a higher level of achievement. On the other hand, disengagement at any time point was consistently associated with lower achievement among low-engaged students. Improving to a higher level of engagement was associated with ---at least--- acceptable achievement levels and rare dropouts. Lack of improvement or ``catching up'' may be a more ominous sign that should be proactively addressed.},

We present VaSSTra: an innovative method for the longitudinal analysis of educational data that can be applied at different time scales (e.g., days, weeks, or courses), and allows the study of different aspects of learning as well as the factors that explain how such aspects evolve over time. Our method combines life- events methods with sequence analysis and consists of three steps: (1) converting variables to states (where variables are grouped into homogenous states); (2) from states to sequences (where the states are used to construct sequences across time), and (3) from sequences to trajectories (where similar sequences are grouped in trajectories). VaSSTra enables us to map the longitudinal unfolding of events while taking advantage of the wealth of life-events methods to visualize, model and describe the temporal dynamics of longitudinal activities. We demonstrate the method with a practical case study example.},

	abstract     = {Research has repeatedly demonstrated that students with effective learning strategies are more likely to have better academic achievement. Existing research has mostly focused on a single course or two, while longitudinal studies remain scarce. The present study examines the longitudinal sequence of students' strategies, their succession, consistency, temporal unfolding, and whether students tend to retain or adapt strategies between courses. We use a large dataset of online traces from 135 students who completed 10 successive courses (i.e., 1350 course enrollments) in a higher education program. The methods used in this study have shown the feasibility of using trace data recorded by learning management systems to unobtrusively trace and model the longitudinal learning strategies across a program. We identified three program-level strategy trajectories: a stable and intense trajectory related to deep learning where students used diverse strategies and scored the highest grades; a fluctuating interactive trajectory, where students focused on course requirements, scored average grades, and were relatively fluctuating; and a light trajectory related to surface learning where students invested the least effort, scored the lowest grades, and had a relatively stable pathway. Students who were intensely active were more likely to transfer the intense strategies and therefore, they were expected to require less support or guidance. Students focusing on course requirements were not as effective self-regulators as they seemed and possibly required early guidance and support from teachers. Students with consistent light strategies or low effort needed proactive guidance and support.},

The changes in five motivational constructs were focused in this research: self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, grade motivation, self-determination, and career motivation. In addition, the relationship between academic track of students and each trajectory group was examined. Using Science Motivation Questionnaire II, data from 255 male high school students were collected during five semesters. Longitudinal data were analyzed by GBTM.. Chi-square analysis was also conducted to examine the relationships between academic track and each trajectory. As a result, it was found that students shared the same trajectory patterns in self-efficacy. Otherwise, two distinct trajectory groups (`high' and `low') were found in each four constructs. There were significant correlations between academic track and trajectory groups. The findings of this research suggest that Korean science educators need to consider individual student's longitudinal trajectory of motivation to provide better science teaching and learning.

Unconditional growth mixture model showed that the three-class model was most appropriate in capturing the latent heterogeneity (i.e., low-achieving/increasing, moderate-achieving/decreasing, and high-achieving/slightly increasing). Two covariates (i.e., gender and SES in ninth grade) were positively associated with the intercept growth factor (i.e., initial GPA) in two of the three achievement classes (i.e., high-achieving and moderate-achieving). In contrast, two other covariates (i.e., Hispanic and African American) were negatively associated with the intercept growth factor in all of the achievement classes. The multinomial logistic regression coefficients identified an increase in the likelihood of belonging to the following achievement classes: (1) Moderate-achieving, if the students were male or African American and of low SES, (2) Low-achieving, if the students were male and of low SES, and (3) High-achieving, if the students were female and of an ethnicity other than African American and high SES. The probability of not applying for college was higher among the low-achieving and the moderate-achieving classes compared with the high-achieving class (223 words).}

  abstract  = "This article provides an overview of a group-based statistical
               methodology for analyzing developmental trajectories - the
               evolution of an outcome over age or time. Across all application
               domains, this group-based statistical method lends itself to the
               presentation of findings in the form of easily understood
               graphical and tabular data summaries. In so doing, the method
               provides statistical researchers with a tool for figuratively
               painting a statistical portrait of the predictors and
               consequences of distinct trajectories of development. Data
               summaries of this form have the great advantage of being
               accessible to nontechnical audiences and quickly comprehensible
               to audiences that are technically sophisticated. Examples of the
               application of the method are provided. A detailed account of
               the statistical underpinnings of the method and a full range of
               applications are provided by the author in a previous study.",

               multiple unobserved sub-populations, describing longitudinal
               change within each unobserved sub-population, and examining
               differences in change among unobserved sub-populations. We
               provide a practical primer that may be useful for researchers
               beginning to incorporate GMM analysis into their research. We
               briefly review basic elements of the standard latent basis
               growth curve model, introduce GMM as an extension of
               multiple-group growth modeling, and describe a four-step
               approach to conducting a GMM analysis. Example data from a
               cortisol stress-response paradigm are used to illustrate the
               suggested procedures.",
