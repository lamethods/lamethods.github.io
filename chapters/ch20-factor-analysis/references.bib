               types of error involved in fitting a model are considered. The
               first is error of approximation which involves the fit of the
               model, with optimally chosen but unknown parameter values, to
               the population covariance matrix. The second is overall error
               which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values
               estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix.
               Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and
               interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures
               take the number of parameters in the model into account in order
               to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties
               associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are

               implemented in LISCOMP. Of main interest is the performance of
               these estimators in relatively small samples (200 to 400) and
               the comparison of their performance with the normal theory
               maximum likelihood estimator given an increasing number of

               parameter estimates and the $\chi$2 goodness-of-fit statistics.

               in educational research and practice. Though frequently employed
               in the learning analytics literature, engagement has been
               subjected to a variety of interpretations and there is little
               consensus regarding the very definition of the construct. This
               raises grave concerns with regards to construct validity:
               namely, do these varied metrics measure the same thing? To
               address such concerns, this paper proposes, quantifies, and
               validates a model of engagement which is both grounded in the
               theoretical literature and described by common metrics drawn
               from the field of learning analytics. To identify a latent
               variable structure in our data we used exploratory factor
               analysis and validated the derived model on a separate
               sub-sample of our data using confirmatory factor analysis. To
               analyze the associations between our latent variables and
               student outcomes, a structural equation model was fitted, and
               the validity of this model across different course settings was
               assessed using MIMIC modeling. Across different domains, the
               broad consistency of our model with the theoretical literature

               error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff
               values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML?based
               SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate

               misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor
               covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s).
               The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value
               close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff
               value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR;
               and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we
               can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the
               hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the
               2?index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable
               proportions of various types of true?population and misspecified
               models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the
               ML?based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true?population
               models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when

              the remaining free parameters estimated by the maximum likelihood
              method. The generality of the approach makes it possible to deal
              with all kinds of solutions: orthogonal, oblique and various
              mixtures of these. By choosing the fixed parameters
              appropriately, factors can be defined to have desired properties

 abstract = {The purposes of the two studies reported in this research are to adapt and validate the instrument of the Evaluation Framework for Learning Analytics (EFLA) for learners into the Turkish context, and to examine how metacognitive and behavioral factors predict learner performance. Study 1 was conducted with 83 online learners enrolled in a 16-week course delivered through the Moodle learning management system. The findings from the confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a three-factor model of the EFLA for learners provided the best model fit for the collected data. The model is consistent with the factorial structure of the original instrument developed based on the data from the European learners. Study 2 aimed to reveal how the metacognitive and behavioral factors pertaining to the learning analytics dashboard predict learners’ academic performance. A total of 63 online learners enrolled in a 14-week online computing course participated in this study. The results from the logistic regression analysis indicated that online learners more frequently interacted with the learning analytics dashboard demonstrated greater academic performance. Furthermore, the dimensions of the EFLA, together with the interaction with the dashboard, significantly predicted learners’ academic performance. This multiple-study investigation contributes to the generalizability of the EFLA for learners and highlights the importance of metacognitive and behavioral factors for the impact of learning analytics dashboards on learner performance.},

               affect the components and examine the probability of TE to
               become a mediator of the correlation between TSC and burnout.
               This research also examined whether the difference emerges
               constantly among demographic information (gender and teaching
               experience) regarding all involved variables. A sample of 876

  abstract = "Evaluation of model fit is critically important for every
              structural equation model (SEM), and sophisticated methods have
              been developed for this task. Among them are the $\chi$²
              goodness-of-fit test, decomposition of the $\chi$², derived
              measures like the popular root mean square error of approximation
              (RMSEA) or comparative fit index (CFI), or inspection of
              residuals or modification indices. Many of these methods provide
              a global approach to model fit evaluation: A single index is
              computed that quantifies the fit of the entire SEM to the data.
              In contrast, graphical criteria like d-separation or
              trek-separation allow derivation of implications that can be used
              for local fit evaluation, an approach that is hardly ever
              applied. We provide an overview of local fit evaluation from the
              viewpoint of SEM practitioners. In the presence of model misfit,
              local fit evaluation can potentially help in pinpointing where
              the problem with the model lies. For models that do fit the data,
              local tests can identify the parts of the model that are
              corroborated by the data. Local tests can also be conducted
              before a model is fitted at all, and they can be used even for
              models that are globally underidentified. We discuss appropriate
              statistical local tests, and provide applied examples. We also
              present novel software in R that automates this type of local fit
              evaluation. (PsycINFO Database Record",

               of learning analytics services. The scales used in the
               instrument are grounded in a theoretical framework of
               expectations, specifically ideal and predicted expectations.

  author   = "Wang, Feng Hsu",
  abstract = "Flipped classrooms supported by learning management systems (LMS)
              have been widely adopted by educational institutions. However,
              earlier studies have found problems with interpreting LMS log
              data to understand student approaches to learning within the
              context of a learning design. This study investigates whether it
              is possible to use LMS log data as a proxy to understand
              students' learning strategies over different periods of time in
              the flipped-classroom context. A total of 135 sophomores from two
              classes of a flipped programming course participated in this
              study. Exploratory factor analysis is first conducted on the log
              data to synthesize second-order predictors based on the
              total-effort model. Then, we investigate the extent to which
              these second-order predictors relate to students' learning
              outcomes over time. Four types of learning outcomes are
              considered, including a quiz, a midterm exam, a final exam and
              the final grade. For each type of learning outcome, multiple
              linear regression is used to construct a weekly prediction model
              from these predictors. Adjusted R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean
              Square Error) are the metrics used to compare the models. The
              results show that consistent second-order predictors can be
              derived from log data, implying that students' clicking events in
              LMS could manifest students' learning strategies understandable
              in the design context of a flipped classroom. Furthermore,
              compared with the first-order models, most of the models
              constructed using the second-order predictors have higher
              predictive performance, although with lower data fitness. In
              addition, the predictive performance of the models with MSLQ
              (Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) indicators and
              past assessment data are also examined. It is found that MSQL
              variables have a positive but short-termed effect on the models'
              predictive ability, while past assessment data greatly improve
              the models of all types of learning outcomes. Theoretical

              prerequisite for such research is to establish measurement
              invariance of the MPQ-SF between different respondent groups, as
              well as across time points. Using a sample of students in an
              international university program (n = 519), the present study
              examines how the scales perform among male and female
              respondents, between students of Western and Non-Western
              background, and across two time points, five months apart. Based
              on our findings, we conclude that all five subscales of the
              MPQ-SF display sufficient measurement invariance to be reliably
              used in this and similar contexts, in comparative as well as
              longitudinal study designs.",

               data from the beta version of the Learning Analytics Readiness
               Instrument (LARI) [1]. Twenty-four institutions were surveyed
               and 560 respondents participated. Five distinct factors were
               identified from a factor analysis of the results: Culture; Data
               Management Expertise; Data Analysis Expertise; Communication and
               Policy Application; and, Training. Data were analyzed using both
               the role of those completing the survey and the Carnegie
               classification of the institutions as lenses. Generally,
               information technology professionals and institutions classified
               as Research Universities--Very High research activity had
               significantly different scores on the identified factors.
               Working within a framework of organizational learning, this
               paper details the concept of readiness as a reflective process,
               as well as how the implementation and application of analytics
               should be done so with ethical considerations in mind.

  abstract = "English: There are many high-quality resources available which
              describe best practices in the implementation of both exploratory
              factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
              Yet, partly owing to the complexity of these procedures,
              confusion persists among psychologists with respect to the
              implementation of EFA and CFA. Primary among these
              misunderstandings is the very mathematical distinction between
              EFA and CFA. The current paper uses a brief example to illustrate
              the difference between the statistical models underlying EFA and
              CFA, both of which are particular instantiations of the more
              general common factor model. Next, important considerations for
              the implementation of EFA and CFA discussed in this paper include
              the need to account for the categorical nature of item-level
              observed variables in factor analyses, the use of factor analysis
              in studies of the psychometric properties of new tests or
              questionnaires and previously developed tests, decisions about
              whether to use EFA or CFA in these contexts, and the importance
              of replication of factor analytic models in the ongoing pursuit
              of validation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights
